## Troubleshooting

### If JavaScript Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check File Paths**: Ensure all JavaScript files are in the correct `assets/js/` directory
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached files
3. **Check Console Errors**: Open F12 and look for red error messages
4. **Verify File Permissions**: Ensure web server can read the JavaScript files
5. **Test Individual Files**: Use the test-js.html file to isolate issues

### Common Issues:
- **CORS Errors**: Make sure you're accessing via web server (not file://)
- **404 Errors**: Check if JavaScript files are in the correct location
- **Syntax Errors**: Use browser console to identify specific line errors
