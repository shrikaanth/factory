# Contact Form Fixes - Final Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Form Action Missing**
- **Problem**: Contact form didn't have an `action` attribute pointing to `process-form.php`
- **Solution**: Added `action="process-form.php"` to the form in `includes/contact-form.php`

### 2. **Database Storage Issues**
- **Problem**: Form submissions weren't being stored in the database consistently
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved database connection handling in `process-form.php`
  - Added automatic table creation if it doesn't exist
  - Added better error handling and logging

### 3. **Email Functionality**
- **Problem**: Email notifications weren't being sent properly
- **Solution**:
  - Created a dedicated `sendEmailNotification()` function
  - Improved email formatting with HTML template
  - Added proper email headers and error handling

### 4. **Form Submission Handling**
- **Problem**: Form only worked with AJAX, no fallback for regular submissions
- **Solution**:
  - Added support for both AJAX and regular form submissions
  - Implemented proper redirect handling for regular submissions
  - Added success/error message display on the contact page

## Files Modified

### 1. `includes/contact-form.php`
- Added `action="process-form.php"` to the form
- Form now properly submits to the processing script

### 2. `process-form.php`
- Complete rewrite with improved functionality:
  - Detects AJAX vs regular form submissions
  - Better database connection and table creation
  - Improved email sending with HTML formatting
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Redirect handling for regular submissions

### 3. `contact.php`
- Added success and error message handling
- Displays feedback when form is submitted
- Shows specific messages for database or email errors

### 4. `assets/js/contact.js`
- Updated to handle both AJAX and regular submissions
- Added fallback mechanism for AJAX failures
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 5. `admin/inquiries.php`
- Complete rewrite with better functionality:
  - View inquiries from both database and file backup
  - Update inquiry status (new, contacted, booked, completed)
  - Better UI with Bootstrap styling
  - Direct email and phone links

## New Files Created

### 1. `test-database.php`
- Database connection test script
- Verifies table creation and data insertion
- Useful for debugging database issues

### 2. `test-contact-form.php`
- Complete test page for contact form functionality
- Includes test instructions and links to admin panel
- Useful for testing the entire system

## How It Works

### 1. **Form Submission Process**
1. User fills out the contact form
2. JavaScript validates the form
3. Form submits via AJAX (with fallback to regular submission)
4. `process-form.php` processes the submission:
   - Validates form data
   - Saves to database (if available)
   - Saves to file as backup
   - Sends email notification
   - Returns appropriate response

### 2. **Database Storage**
- Creates `inquiries` table automatically if it doesn't exist
- Stores all form data with timestamps and IP addresses
- Includes status tracking (new, contacted, booked, completed)

### 3. **Email Notifications**
- Sends HTML-formatted emails to `mail.photofactory@gmail.com`
- Includes all form data in a professional format
- Proper headers and error handling

### 4. **Admin Panel**
- Access via `admin/inquiries.php`
- Password: `admin123` (change this in production)
- View and manage all inquiries
- Update inquiry status
- Direct links to email and phone

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Test Database Connection**
```
http://localhost/factory/test-database.php
```

### 2. **Test Contact Form**
```
http://localhost/factory/test-contact-form.php
```

### 3. **View Admin Panel**
```
http://localhost/factory/admin/inquiries.php
```

### 4. **Test Regular Contact Page**
```
http://localhost/factory/contact.php
```

## Configuration

### 1. **Database Settings** (`includes/db.php`)
- Database name: `photofactory_studio`
- Username: `root` (default XAMPP)
- Password: `` (empty for default XAMPP)

### 2. **Email Settings** (`process-form.php`)
- Recipient: `mail.photofactory@gmail.com`
- From: `Photo Factory Studio <noreply@photofactorystudio.com>`

### 3. **Admin Panel** (`admin/inquiries.php`)
- Password: `admin123` (change this!)

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Form Validation**
- Server-side validation in `process-form.php`
- Client-side validation in JavaScript
- SQL injection protection with prepared statements

### 2. **Email Security**
- Input sanitization before email sending
- Proper email headers to prevent spoofing

### 3. **Admin Panel**
- Simple session-based authentication
- Should be enhanced for production use

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **Database Issues**
- Check XAMPP MySQL service is running
- Verify database credentials in `includes/db.php`
- Run `test-database.php` to diagnose issues

### 2. **Email Issues**
- Email sending may not work on localhost
- Check server mail configuration
- Form data is still saved to database/file

### 3. **Form Not Submitting**
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Verify `process-form.php` exists and is accessible
- Test with regular form submission (disable JavaScript)

## Production Deployment

### 1. **Database**
- Use proper database credentials
- Ensure database server is secure
- Regular backups recommended

### 2. **Email**
- Configure proper SMTP settings
- Use a reliable email service
- Test email delivery

### 3. **Security**
- Change admin password
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular security updates

## Summary

The contact form system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Database storage
- ✅ Email notifications
- ✅ AJAX and regular form submissions
- ✅ Admin panel for managing inquiries
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Backup file storage
- ✅ Comprehensive testing tools

All pages using the contact form (`contact.php`, `index.php`, `pre-wedding.php`, `destination-wedding.php`) will now work properly with the improved system.
